## About
* Visual Recap is a video summarization application written in python. The logic of summarizatiom lies in Firefly Algorithm.
* The summarization is based on object of interest and few other factors like similarity and dissimilarity factor.
* A firefly here is a set of frames. The intensity or correctness of a firefly depends on the similarity of the frames it holds with the object of interest and some other factors.
* The algorithm runs to find the best firefly which eventually gives us the frames of our summarized video.
* The dataset used here is TVSum.

## Tech-Stack Used
* Python
* OpenCV, NumPy and other libraries
